# T.E.A.V.S.R.P.
The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P.) is an April Fools' Day joke added to Minecraft: Java Edition April 1, 2014. 11 years later, it's now available on Bedrock!

T.E.A.V.S.R.P. for BE is an unofficial port of the second version, available for free at [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20141118054421/https://www.elementanimation.com/TEAVSRP2.zip), porting all the sounds directly from the original pack to Bedrock Edition.
